    "    - You have direct access to the files, using plain HTTPs or Azure Blob Storage APIs. This means you can open the files using any tool that can speak HTTP\n",
    "2. Cloud-native formats\n",
    "    - Wherever possible, we use cloud-native / friendly file formats. We'll see examples using COG, Zarr, (geo)parquet, and COPC\n",
    "3. Compute is next to the data\n",
    "    - All of our files are in the West Europe Azure data region. For best performance, compute should be in that same data center.\n",
    "4. Ability to scale\n",
    "    - Azure makes it easy to get lots of compute\n",
